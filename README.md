# final-project-w4b
This project by Conor Miles. It is a website for a motown night I host in Fresno occasionally. I hope to eventually have ticket links, gallery, videos, a short bio, and a contact form for anyone interested in more info. This is for the geekwise class "websites for beginners" that I completed on 12/13/2022
