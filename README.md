# final-project-w4b
This project is by Conor Miles. It is a website for fresno's motown night which I host at strummers bar and grill occasionally. I hope to eventually have ticket links, a gallery, videos, a short bio, and a contact form for anyone interested in more info. This is for the geekwise class "websites for beginners" that I completed on 12/13/2022
